## API

To make API available, specify `API_CORS_HOST` after you deploy the app.

- Open the created project on Vercel and go to **Settings**.
- Open tab **Environment Variables**
- Create a variable with the name `API_CORS_HOST` and put the site address from which you plan to make requests for example `https://example.com` (the variable will be set to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. [More about the header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin))
